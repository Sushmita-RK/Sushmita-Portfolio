# Sushmita's Professional React Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built from scratch using React.js to showcase my skills, experience, and projects.

The project is a fully responsive Single Page Application (SPA) designed with a modern "glassmorphism" dark theme, colorful gradients, and subtle animations to create an engaging and professional user experience.
